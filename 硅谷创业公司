    Company Intro
    - Backed by a16z and other top-tier funds in Silicon Valley. 
    - building the monetization layer for the next generation of GenAI traffic. 
    - mission: build the native ads system for the GenAI age. 
      1. Generative AI is not only a form of intelligence, but also a fundamentally superior form of content, that is more expressive, more engaging, and personalized than traditional static content. It will take increasing large amount of consumer attention from the legacy platforms. 
      2. Where there is consumer attention, there will be ads. We organize the world's information in the most economic way.
    Hiring manager: Jason is the CEO and co-founder of the company. He has a background in NLP research, tech startup, and ads system, and is fascinated by the software paradigm shifts brought by new technology.

Our values
1. long-term thinking & integrity
  1. Integrity leads to better results in the long term, it forces us to not take shortcuts, and focus on actual high-quality growth and build our core competence.
  2. Long-term successful company cannot be built from greedy optimization (constantly optimize for short-term objectives for each step in his history), and it requires taking the courage to forgo short-term interest 
2. move fast, break things, and learn from it 
  1. We're building in the cutting edge space. There will be trial and errors and we learn from that. We want people to have bravery and initiative to make these experiments. 
  2. Bad consequences are acceptable, as long as the decision is well-thought of and gives us learning.
3. ownership & initiative 
  1. We want self-starters who can have a sense of ownership and don't need external supervision
4. client/user-focused 
  1. Especially in the beginning, we need to gain the trust of our advertisers and publishers by exceeding their expectations. 
  2. This happens at every detailed level, at every touch point from initial contact, the content & material we deliver them, to ultimately the ROI of product that we deliver to them

    - Strong interest in GenAI 
    - Have experience in high-growth team/project at established companies or experience at startup

Research engineer - generative video (accept intern/full-time/part-time)
  - Responsibility 
    - Follow cutting-edge results in video generation and video editing
    - Build and iterate research prototypes in fast iterations to achieve key business objectives 
    - Productionize the prototypes with the engineering team and ensure key performance metrics in monetization and user experience 
    - Note: this role does not involve training foundation models, but rather focuses on building products based on foundation model capabilities 
  - Requirement 
    - Strong passion and experience in generative AI, especially in generative video and video editing space 
    - Experience with leading AI research tech stack, including but not limited to Python, PyTorch, cuda, etc.
